## Packages
framer-motion | For smooth animations of trust scores and page transitions
recharts | To visualize the trust score history in the audit log
date-fns | For formatting timestamps in a readable way

## Notes
- The app uses Replit Auth. Authentication state is handled by `useAuth`.
- The trust score is a float from 0.0 to 1.0. 
- UI should feel "hacker/academic" with dark mode, monospace data, and neon accents.
